**Summary of the data processed in Alteryx (Since Tableau is quite visible in the screenshots:**

Security:
Overall, based on Crime_Score, Tangling District and Woodlands District seems to be the top choice.

Comparing between these two, if the client is coming to Singapore for work and will not be at home for large portion of time, Woodlands district with Low level of Housebreaking will be ideal for the client. Furthermore, Woodlands District also have low level  of Outrage of Modesty and low level of Robbery relative to other districts.

Pricing:
Depending on the preference of size of the property that the client is looking for, the client can look at Jurong, Ang Mo Kio and Bedok District for relatively smaller sizes of landed property while look at Tanglin and Central District for larger sizes of landed property.

After selecting the preferred size, the client can look at the predicted pricing of different type of landed property based on the average size of that district.
Client can also compare prices of the same type of property across district.

All this can help the client to know which area to start searching for property that matches their area and price preference, reducing searching time and increasing the chances of them finding what they want.

Education:
Assuming that client is either a student studying in Singapore or have children that going to study in Singapore, client can look at the distribution of primary, school, secondary school or junior college to know where to stay to have all three levels of education close to their house.

From the data, we can see that Ang Mo Kio District has the highest number of JC, secondary and primary school and thus suggest that staying in Ang Mo Kio, client have more choices of school that is near them. However, client do need to know that the security in Ang Mo Kio District is relatively low relatively to other district (tradeoff)

Lastly, the client can look at district that offer SAP programme if they are interested in developing bilingual language. If the client want to skip O level, the client can see which district has the most number of schools offering IP programmes.
